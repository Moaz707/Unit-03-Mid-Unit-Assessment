#Unit 03 Mid-Unit Assessment

###### My Familiar in this app:

I felt so familiar with this app entirely , but i just take my while to write the whole code .
I'm so happy had the chance to do this app.

###### My difficulites in this app:

I had issue doing the intent to go the other Activity inside the ViewHolder ,but After a lot of search , ifound that we have to use v.getContext()
to startActivity for the (intent), which it was something new for me , Im so happy to learn that.


##Thank you so much for Everything we learn from all of you
